**primary goal**: run CNN on the multiplexer problem (6 bit)

Toward this goal, I need to:

- [ ] set up basic development/exploration environment
    - [-] observablehq
    - [-] jupyter notebooks
    - [x] vim and ipython

- [ ] try out various deep neural networks
    - [ ] convolutional - more for GWAS it seems?Â 
    - [ ] multilayer perceptron - shown to work in the past
        - using https://www.jessicayung.com/explaining-tensorflow-code-for-a-multilayer-perceptron/ as a guide

- [ ] good overview of neural networks
    - http://www.faqs.org/faqs/ai-faq/neural-nets/part1/section-7.html

Questions
- [ ] how to inform neural network about binary inputs?

- [ ] next steps, write a generator
